# Video-cut-and-crop-python
A simple application made using customtkinter and some other python libraries that allows the user to import a video and crop/split the video and save a new version of it
when cropping select crop and drag a box around how you want it to be cropped, then press finish crop, when splitting the white bar under the slider that represents the videos time represents the where it is going to be split, which will just be whatever time you have the time slider under the video at.
